At this pre-event, we will give a short overview about what the [MAgPIE](https://github.com/magpiemodel/magpie) framework is, how it looks like, and what it is used for. Besides that, we will share some further information about the upcoming workshop, in particular, we will ask participants to have MAgPIE installed prior to it.
