This workshop session will give you an overview about the model code, how it is managed and how it is read. The first tutorial will give an overview about the GAMS code and its underlying modules and realizations. The next tutorial will focus on the model documentation, where it can be found and how it is created. The final tutorial of the session will focus on how the  projects package dependencies are managed using [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html).
