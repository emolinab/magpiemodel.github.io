In the first workshop we will give a short overview about what the [MAgPIE](https://github.com/magpiemodel/magpie) framework is, how it looks like, and what it is used for. This is followed by the first of the interactive tutorials which will give a brief introduction into the version control management of MAgPIE via git/github.
