This event is optional and only relevant if you encountered problems performing the steps mentioned in the models [README.md] installation guidelines.

Participants are required to have MAgPIE properly installed to be able to interactively follow the different workshop exercises. A pool of helpers will be available during the meeting to assist you in installing MAgPIE on your system.
