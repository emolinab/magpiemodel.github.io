After a one year break we will have our next MAgPIE workshop & stories event mid of April this year. This time we will organize it in a hybrid format hosted on the Telegrafenberg at the [Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research]. During this 3 day event we will have a mix of an introduction workshop for the [MAgPIE] model and the underlying [MADRaT] data processing framework as well as two MAgPIE stories sessions in which current users and developers of the model present their most recent work.

Course fee is 280€ for in-person participation with a total of 20 tickets available and 50€ for online participation with another 30 tickets available. The [registration] for the workshop is now open: [-> click here <-]. A call for contributions for the MAgPIE stories event will follow soon and does not require a workshop registration (online participation primarily enivisioned).
