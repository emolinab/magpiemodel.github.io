After our succesful 2 days [MAgPIE] training workshop from September 9th and 10th last year at [PIK], the date and format for this years training workshop have finaly been settled: Due to CORVID19 we decided to switch the an online course splitting last years 2-day course into 5 shorter 
events stretched over 5 days with a length of 1-3 hours each. Sessions will take place from **Dec 7<sup>th</sup> to Dec 11<sup>th</sup>** each starting 9am GMT.

As last year the workshop will be based on the [MAgPIE tutorials] available online and presented by various members of the [MAgPIE] development team, giving you the opportunity to not only getting to know the model but also the team behind it.

To slightly counterbalance the downsides coming with the restrictions in this exceptional year we decided to cover the costs of this years event and make it **free of charge** for all participants (registration will still be required)! 

We are currently in the process of preparing the registration process and finalizing the schedule. So please keep an eye on this page as updates will follow soon!
