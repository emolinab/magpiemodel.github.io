~~The registration for the MAgPIE 2020 training workshop **Dec 7<sup>th</sup> to Dec 11<sup>th</sup>** is now online! In case you want to join, please submit your registration as early as possible, latest **Nov 22<sup>nd</sup>**~~. The event is free of charge but **registration is required** to allow us to plan the event accordingly.

Please be prepared that it may take a few days before you get your registration confirmed via mail. Please contact us via <magpie@pik-potsdam.de> in case you do not receive a confirmation mail within 1 week after registration. 

**Due to higher than expected number of registrations we had to close the registration a few days earlier.** If you were not able to register before the registration closed we can invite you to take our tutorials [online](https://github.com/magpiemodel/tutorials) or wait for our upcoming workshop next year.
