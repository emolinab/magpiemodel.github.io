#### submission deadline: ~~15.01.2022~~ 26.01.2022 (extended)

Since the first open-source release of [MAgPIE] in 2019 the community around the model has started to grow. To foster the community aspect and to create a space for productive exchange we decided to extend our next virtual **MAgPIE workshop** in **March 2022** by **MAgPIE stories**, an event dedicated to sharing specific experiences of using [MAgPIE]. The aim is to give room for everyone to share their [MAgPIE]-related research and to allow the community to get an overview about the various currently ongoing activities.

**MAgPIE stories** will be subsequent to the **MAgPIE training workshop**. In contrast to the introductory training workshop, the **MAgPIE stories** event is targeting the [MAgPIE] community as a whole including *all* levels of experience. The sessions will be put together by the organizing team based on the submissions. We invite submissions about [MAgPIE] related projects and activities in *all* development stages from drafting phase to finished research. **MAgPIE stories** will have the form of a talk with room for discussion afterwards.

The organizing team is looking forward to receiving submissions of your very own **MAgPIE stories** and projects you want to share with us.

### Who can submit?

We welcome submissions from anyone currently working or planning to work with the [MAgPIE] modeling framework. These include, but are not limited to:

* Researchers just started looking into [MAgPIE] who want to pitch their research idea.
* Framework users who want to share their experience (struggles/success stories) with [MAgPIE]
* Developers who want to share their newest piece of development
* Researchers showing their newest findings from their model-based research

Our aim is to have a balanced program that reflects the diversity of perspectives and the different levels of expertise. Especially, we encourage users who have just started to use [MAgPIE] to talk about what they plan to do with it. We would like to explicitly invite *all* individuals from underrepresented groups and early career researchers to submit as well!

Submissions will be reviewed in a *single-blind* process, which means that reviewers will be able to see the names and institutions of origin of authors.
