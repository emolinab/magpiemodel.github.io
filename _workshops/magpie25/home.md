Welcome to the homepage for the MAgPIE 25 workshop which will take place from **16th to 18th of June 2025**.

Our next MAgPIE workshop & stories event is returning in mid-June 2025. Similar to last year, it will take place in a hybrid format, hosted on the Telegrafenberg at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research for on-site participants, while online participants will join via Zoom. During this 3-day event, we will have a mixture of an introduction workshop for the MAgPIE model and the underlying MADRaT data processing framework, as well as two MAgPIE stories sessions where current users and developers of the model present their most recent work.
