# Feeding back to the main Repository

MAgPIE lives through its community of developers and is based on the idea
that all research should be open, accessible and usable. While not enforced by
any contract or license we ask all developers to feed there model developments
back to the main repository to make them easily accessible to the whole
community. Doing so means additional efforts on the developer side in order
to fulfill the requirements for merging it into the main branch of the model
(explained further down below), but also comes with a series of advantages:

* Developments get a **higher visibility** when put in the main repository compared
to keeping them in a personal or even private repository. This increases
the likelihood that the new research is taken up, further checked and finally
cited in upcoming work.

* Feeding your work back to the main repository will **encourage others** to do the
same which will grant access to cool new features one otherwise would not get

* Feeding developments back ensures that upcoming developments are **compatible**
to the own work and avoids running into a state in which the own model version
is so different to the main version that it cannot easily be merged again

* In publications you will be able to just **refer to a main release** of the model
rather than needing to explain how your specific version relates to the main
line of the model.

The past years have told us that 1. new features in the model will be taken up
by researchers and leading to new and exciting research and that 2. the researcher
originally developing that feature will benefit from it through new collaborations
and publications.

# Requirements for code in order to be accepted in the main repository

The ability to feed code back to the main repository unfortunately does not come
for free. In order to keep the model in a usable form for everybody there are
some quality criteria model updates must fulfill in order to be accepted. What
this criteria are and why they are so important will be explained in the following:

* **handling of regional data**:
* **performance**:
* **codeing etiquette**:
